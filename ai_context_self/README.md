# AI Context Manager - Self-Hosted Context

This directory contains the AI context system used by AI assistants when working on the AI Context Manager project itself.

## Meta-Context

This is a **self-hosting** implementation where the AI Context Manager uses itself for its own development. This serves as:

- **Validation** - Proves the system works by using it on itself
- **Documentation** - Living documentation of the development process
- **Testing** - Real-world testing of all features
- **Example** - Demonstrates the system's effectiveness

## Files

- `core.json` - Essential rules and project information for AI Context Manager
- `architecture.json` - Package structure and technical details
- `user_experience.json` - Developer experience and user needs
- `troubleshooting.json` - Development debugging guides
- `learning_history.json` - Development learnings and decisions

## Usage

When working on AI Context Manager development:

1. **Always read these context files** at the start of each conversation
2. **Follow the self-hosting rules** documented in core.json
3. **Update learning_history.json** with new development insights
4. **Use the system on itself** to validate new features

## Self-Hosting Rules

- Always use AI Context Manager's own context when developing it
- Test new features by using them on this project first
- Document learnings in this context system
- Validate that the system works by using it on itself

## Benefits

- **Immediate feedback** on system effectiveness
- **Real-world testing** of all features
- **Living documentation** of the development process
- **Demonstrates value** to potential users

This is the ultimate test of the AI Context Manager's effectiveness - if it can't manage its own development context effectively, it won't work for other projects either.
