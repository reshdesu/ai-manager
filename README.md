**Intelligent AI context management system for any project.**

AI Context Manager helps AI assistants maintain persistent context across conversations, automatically organize and optimize context files, and learn from your development patterns.

## 🚀 Features

- **Persistent AI Context**: Maintain context across conversations with AI assistants
- **Automated Maintenance**: Automatically organize, optimize, and version control context files
- **Pattern Learning**: Learn from your development patterns and suggest improvements
- **Multi-Project Support**: Manage context for different project types
- **Self-Hosting**: The system uses itself for its own development (ultimate dogfooding)
- **Professional Packaging**: Ready for PyPI distribution with proper CLI interface

## 📦 Installation

### From Source (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reshdesu/ai-context-manager.git
cd ai-context-manager
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

### From PyPI (Coming Soon)

```bash
pip install ai-context-manager
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Initialize AI Context for Your Project

```bash
ai-context init "My Project" --type web_application
```

This creates a comprehensive AI context system in your project:
- `ai_context/core.json` - Essential project information and rules
- `ai_context/architecture.json` - Project structure and technical details
- `ai_context/user_experience.json` - User needs and pain points
- `ai_context/troubleshooting.json` - Common issues and solutions
- `ai_context/learning_history.json` - Development learnings and patterns

### 2. Check Status

```bash
ai-context status
```

### 3. Maintain Context

```bash
ai-context maintain
```

## 🛠️ Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `ai-context init <name> [--type <type>]` | Initialize AI context for a project |
| `ai-context status` | Show status of AI context system |
| `ai-context maintain` | Maintain and optimize context files |
| `ai-context version` | Show version information |

### Project Types

- `general` - General purpose project
- `web_application` - Web applications (React, Vue, Django, Flask, etc.)
- `desktop_application` - Desktop applications (Electron, Qt, etc.)
- `data_engineering` - Data science and ML projects
- `mobile_application` - Mobile apps (React Native, Flutter, etc.)

## 🏗️ Self-Hosting

AI Context Manager uses itself for its own development - this is the ultimate validation of its effectiveness.

### Self-Hosted Context

The AI Context Manager maintains its own development context in `ai_context_self/`:
- Documents its own development decisions
- Tracks its own learning patterns
- Validates features by using them on itself
- Creates living documentation of the development process

### Self-Maintenance

```bash
# Create self-hosted context
python3 self_hosted_ai_context.py

# Maintain self-hosted context
python3 self_maintenance.py
```

## 🔧 Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reshdesu/ai-context-manager.git
cd ai-context-manager
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### Run Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Read Self-Hosted Context**: Start by reading `ai_context_self/` files
2. **Follow Self-Hosting Rules**: Use the system on itself
3. **Test New Features**: Validate by using on this project first
4. **Document Decisions**: Update `learning_history.json`
5. **Maintain Context**: Run self-maintenance regularly
