# Agent-Project Relationship Architecture

## The Core Question
How should AI agents work with their own projects? Should they live in separate codebases or within our main AI Context Manager codebase?

## Architectural Approaches

### 1. **Separate Codebases Model**
```
ai-context-manager/          # Main coordinator
├── src/core/
├── src/services/
└── config/

blaze-backup-system/        # Separate project
├── src/
├── config/
├── tests/
└── blaze_agent.py

maya-3d-studio/             # Separate project  
├── src/
├── config/
├── tests/
└── maya_agent.py
```

**Pros:**
- Complete independence and isolation
- Each agent can have its own dependencies
- Agents can be developed/deployed independently
- Clear separation of concerns
- Agents can have their own versioning

**Cons:**
- Complex communication between agents
- Duplicate infrastructure (each needs its own CI/CD)
- Harder to share common utilities
- More complex deployment and management

### 2. **Monorepo with Agent Projects**
```
ai-context-manager/
├── src/core/               # Core AI Context Manager
├── src/services/           # Shared services
├── agents/
│   ├── blaze/              # Blaze agent project
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   ├── config/
│   │   ├── tests/
│   │   └── blaze_agent.py
│   └── maya/               # Maya agent project
│       ├── src/
│       ├── config/
│       ├── tests/
│       └── maya_agent.py
├── shared/                 # Shared utilities
└── config/
```

**Pros:**
- Shared infrastructure and utilities
- Easier communication between agents
- Single deployment pipeline
- Shared configuration management
- Easier to maintain consistency

**Cons:**
- Potential coupling between agents
- Larger codebase to manage
- Agents might interfere with each other
- Harder to scale individual agents

### 3. **Plugin Architecture**
```
ai-context-manager/
├── src/core/
├── src/services/
├── plugins/
│   ├── blaze_plugin/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── agent.py
│   │   └── config.json
│   └── maya_plugin/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── agent.py
│       └── config.json
└── config/
```

**Pros:**
- Highly modular and extensible
- Easy to add/remove agents
- Standardized interface
- Hot-swappable agents
- Clear plugin boundaries

**Cons:**
- Limited agent complexity
- Plugin interface constraints
- Harder to implement complex agent logic
- Potential performance overhead

### 4. **Hybrid Microservices Model**
```
ai-context-manager/          # Main coordinator
├── src/core/
├── src/services/
└── config/

agent-services/             # Separate but coordinated
├── blaze-service/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── docker-compose.yml
├── maya-service/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── docker-compose.yml
└── shared-libs/            # Shared libraries
```

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds
- Independent deployment
- Shared utilities
- Scalable architecture
- Clear service boundaries

**Cons:**
- More complex infrastructure
- Requires containerization
- Network communication overhead
- More complex debugging

## Agent-Specific Considerations

### Blaze Agent (Backup & Storage)
**Needs:**
- Access to file systems
- Storage management capabilities
- Backup scheduling
- Data integrity verification
- Storage optimization

**Recommendation:** Separate service or plugin with file system access

### Maya Agent (3D Modeling)
**Needs:**
- 3D rendering capabilities
- Graphics libraries
- Large file handling
- GPU access potentially
- Complex dependencies

**Recommendation:** Separate service with specialized dependencies

## Recommended Architecture

Based on the analysis, I recommend the **Hybrid Microservices Model**:

1. **Core AI Context Manager**: Centralized coordination and communication
2. **Agent Services**: Independent services for each agent type
3. **Shared Libraries**: Common utilities and interfaces
4. **Plugin Interface**: Standardized communication protocol

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Current Structure (Monorepo)
- Keep current organized structure
- Implement proper agent interfaces
- Add shared utilities

### Phase 2: Service Extraction
- Extract agents to separate services
- Implement API-based communication
- Add service discovery

### Phase 3: Containerization
- Dockerize each agent service
- Add orchestration (Docker Compose/Kubernetes)
- Implement health checks and monitoring

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Auto-scaling based on workload
- Service mesh for communication
- Advanced monitoring and logging

## Communication Protocol

```python
# Agent Interface
class AgentInterface:
    def register(self, context_manager_url: str) -> bool
    def send_message(self, target: str, message: str) -> bool
    def receive_messages(self) -> List[Message]
    def get_status(self) -> AgentStatus
    def process_request(self, request: Request) -> Response
```

## Configuration Management

```yaml
# agent-config.yaml
agents:
  blaze:
    service_url: "http://blaze-service:8080"
    capabilities: ["backup", "storage"]
    dependencies: ["filesystem", "storage"]
  
  maya:
    service_url: "http://maya-service:8080"
    capabilities: ["3d_modeling", "rendering"]
    dependencies: ["opengl", "gpu"]
```

This architecture provides the flexibility for agents to have their own specialized environments while maintaining coordination through the central AI Context Manager.
